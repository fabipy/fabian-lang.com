## Navigate the Web faster with Vimium C

Are you still using your keyboard and mouse to browse the web?
What if there was a way to browse the web with only your keyboard while maintaining the same speed or even increasing productivity?

If you are already familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a> (Unix) you might have guessed that "Vimium" consists of the two words **Vim** and **Chromium**. 

For anyone who is not familiar with Vim: It is basically a free and open-source, highly customizable text editor. Just imagine a regular text editor on any device, but on steroids. You can learn some basic Vim with this <a href="https://www.openvim.com/" target="_blank">browser-based introduction</a>. Actually, even more experienced users might be able to learn something useful. At least for me this was the case.

#### How does it work?

Now that we know what Vim is all about, how the heck are Vim functionalities supposed to help browsing the web? Vimium C is a browser extension (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium-c-all-by-keyboard/hfjbmagddngcpeloejdejnfgbamkjaeg?hl=en" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/">Firefox</a>) and once you installed it you can use the keyboard shortcuts on any website (don't worry you can also exclude websites in the settings!). 

Let me show you my favourite (most used) keyboard shortcuts:

- Scroll up (**j**) and down (**k**)
- Scroll down page (**d**) and up (**u**)
- Scroll left (**h**) and right (**l**)
- Move to top of page (**g**) and bottom (**G**, i.e. shift+g)
- Jump tab on the left (**J**) right tab (**K**)
- Open link with **f** (little pop-ups with letter combinations show up that you can enter to open a link)
- Open link in new tab with **F**, i.e. shift+f
- Open mulitple links in new tabs with **alt+F** 
- Move tab left (**<<**) and right (**>>**)

Other important shortcuts:
- Switch to last active tab on same window (**^**)
- Text box focus (**gi**) switch text box with tab
- Close tab (**x**)
- Open recently closed tab (**X**, i.e. shift+x)
- Open omnibar to search in same tab (**o**)
- Open omnibar to search in new tab (**O**, i.e. shift+o)
- There are many more, simply press **?** to show all available commands

Also don't forget that it is possible to add the number modifier to many of these shortcuts, e.g. 3j will scroll down three times, 3K will jump three tabs to the left and 5x will close 5 tabs.

The best of all is that I even use it on my smartphone. The official chrome app doesn't support browser extensions, however there are alternatives on the app store that do. Simply download the Yandex or Kiwi browser to install the Vimium C extension and connect your bluetooth keyboard. Note: I tried both but the Yandex browser seems to work better (Android). I haven't tried it on Firefox for Mobile though.
