This is a Twitter data visualization I did with Tableau when I was doing my Bachelor's degree at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
The project involved pulling data from Twitter with the REST API and subsequently doing some pre-processing, visualization and analysis.

Feel free to explore it following this [link](https://twitterviz.blogspot.com/2019/03/big-data-analyzing-twitter-topics-users.html). 

I will add some more information about the project soon.
