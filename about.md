### Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Fabian and I studied Media and Computational Linguistics (also known as Natural Language Processing).

With my blog I intend to share some of my interests with you. I gradually work to improve the content and to provide more information / write new blog posts.

Please share the content if you like it.
