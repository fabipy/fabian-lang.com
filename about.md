## Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Fabian and I studied Media and Computational Linguistics ([What is Computational Linguistics?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics))

In my blog I intend to share some of my interests with you. I gradually work to improve the content and to provide more information / blog posts.

Please share the content if you like it.
