### Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Fabian and I studied Media and Computational Linguistics 
([What is Computational Linguistics?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics))

With my blog I intend to share some of my interests with you. I gradually work to improve the content and to provide more information / write new blog posts.

Please share the content if you like it.


This is me:

Enjoy!
